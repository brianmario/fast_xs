== DESCRIPTION:

fast_xs provides C extensions for escaping text.

The original String#fast_xs method is based on the xchar code by Sam Ruby:

* http://intertwingly.net/stories/2005/09/28/xchar.rb
* http://intertwingly.net/blog/2005/09/28/XML-Cleansing

_why also packages an older version with Hpricot (patches submitted).
The version here should be compatible with the latest version of Hpricot
code.

Ruby on Rails will automatically use String#fast_xs from either Hpricot
or this gem version with the bundled Builder package.

String#fast_xs is an almost exact translation of Sam Ruby's original
implementation (String#to_xs), but it does escape "&quot;" (which is
optional, but all parsers are able to handle it).  XML::Builder as
packaged in Rails 2.0 will be automatically use String#fast_xs instead
of String#to_xs available.

=== EXTRA:

'fast_xs_extra' is an experimental extension that can be used with
'fast_xs_monkey_patcher' to monkey patch methods in common libraries:

  CGI, ERB::Util, Rack::Utils, Mongrel

However, 'fast_xs_extra' does not provide a significant performance
boost like 'fast_xs' does under Ruby 1.8.

== COMPATIBILITY:

This package aims to be compatible with Ruby 1.8 and 1.9.  It is however
not as helpful in Ruby 1.9 which already provides encoding-aware string
functions.  Rubinius compatibility may happen in the future if deemed
necessary, but this extension seems to be against the spirit of the
Rubinius project.
